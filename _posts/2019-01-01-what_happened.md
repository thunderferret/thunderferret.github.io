All I ever think about is your pretty face<br>
선이 예쁜 몸매 with a little taste
패션킬러 자기한테
뭐가 잘 어울리는 지를 아는 것 같애
그래서인지 너 주위엔 남자가 많아
걔넨 너와 시덥잖은 대화를 나눠 it’s a problem
When they too intrusive, gotta throw them deuces
Chill with me, oh please help me cupid
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
You had to come without your friends
I noticed you were uncomfortable
We can blow this off and go on a date
Eh 여태까지 만나본 사람중에
제일로 내 스타일
자주 웃어줘 with the best smile
You got it, you got it
I'ma have to do something about it
Baby 호흡곤란 너 땜에
Aiming so high ma bae
이곳을 떠나기 전에
네 가슴 한가운데에 맞게끔
Pull it back and I shoot, ya
날려줘 빨리
Hey cupid why you hiding
Shoot on and shoot on
날려줘 빨리
My cupid where you at right now 
Shoot on and shoot on
What brand of jeans, you be rocking
잘 어울리는 청바지
또는 너의 걸음걸이 모습 마치 (wow)
도수코 런웨이 위 같지
왜냐면 넌 cat walking
They watching
보는 눈이 많을 수록
You keep it one hunnit
도도함 어디서 배운거야 진짜
떨리지만 일단 하러 가고있어 인사
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
You had to come without your friends
I noticed you were uncomfortable
We can blow this off and go on a date
대답해줘 가능하면 좀 빨리
겉은 쿨해도 내 마음속은 난리
You got it, you got it (you got it)
I'ma have to do something about it
Baby 호흡곤란 너 땜에
Aiming so high ma bae
이곳을 떠나기 전에
네 가슴 한가운데에 맞게끔
Pull it back and I shoot, ya
날려줘 빨리
Hey cupid why you hiding
Shoot on and shoot on
날려줘 빨리
My cupid where you at right now
Shoot on and shoot on
Lil baby with an arrow
Help a brother (help a brother)
If you got a bad aim
Just don’t bother
It might pinch but that’s okay because
I wanna get close to you (close to you)
I wanna get close to you (close to you)
I wanna get close to you
Where you at cupid, I really need you right now
Where you at cupid, I really need you right now
Where you at cupid, I really need you right now
Where you at cupid, I really really really
어디야
날려줘 빨리 (ooh, no, no, no)
Hey cupid why you hiding
Shoot on and shoot on (shoot on)
날려줘 빨리
My cupid where you at right now
Shoot on and shoot on, yeah
